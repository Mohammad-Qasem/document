              <h3>
                  Polydactyl
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Let’s be real, polydactyl cats give the best high-fives. Errr, high-sixes. Also known as "mitten cats" or "thumb cats," polydactyls have a genetic mutation that gives them more than the usual number of toes on one or more feet. Polydactyl cats can have anywhere from six to eight toes per paw. The extra toes sometimes make them look like their paws have thumbs. While polydactyly can happen in many different animals (including humans), it’s arguably cutest in cats. Writer Ernest Hemingway certainly thought so—he himself was a polydactyl owner, and the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum is now home to some 50 polydactyl cats.

              <h3>
                  Snowshoe
                </h3>
              <p>
                  what it was bred from: a Siamese with white "boots" that turned up in the litter of a Siamese breeder in Philadelphia in the 1960s. The particular Snowshoe look is difficult to breed, so registered purebred Snowshoe cats are rare. But there are many cats in shelters who have some or all of its traits, such as the white paws, dark mask, and beautiful blue eyes—so if you’re interested in this kind of cat, you can always get "the look for less."

              <h3>Calico</h3>
              <p>It is impossible to clone a calico cat with the same markings, because of the random activation of genes. The necessary traits for calico patterning are on the X-chromosome, therefore nearly all calico cats are female. Male calico cats are few and far between, and can only exist as a result of genetic defect.</p>

              <h3>British Shorthair</h3>
              <p>The British Shorthair is known for both its looks and its typically easygoing and fun-loving personality. The appealing chunkiness of its face and body and its plush, thick fur match its sturdy temperament. The wide-cheeked faces of British Shorthairs appear to be smiling and more expressive than many cat breeds’, and it’s said that they were the inspiration for the wide-grinning Cheshire Cat of Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. British Shorthairs are reputed to be doglike in their readiness for fun and games, such as fetching.</p>

              <h3>Siamese</h3>
              <p>Who can resist the Siamese cat’s pretty blue eyes? These cats have been valued for their unique patterning and outspoken personalities for centuries. Long a status symbol, Siamese cats have been given to dignitaries as gifts. They made their U.S. debut in 1878 when one was given to President Rutherford B. Hayes and his wife by an American consul. These cats are especially known as being very vocal—their loud meows are sometimes mistaken for babies crying!</p>

              <h3>Norwegian Forest Cat</h3>
              <p>If you like hugging a cat who’s a big armload of fur and can take what you dish out, then the Norwegian Forest Cat is for you. A big cat with big paws and lots of fur, the Norwegian is like a Maine Coon cat’s Viking cousin. The large, muscular, affectionate, and calm Norwegian has a dense and water-resistant double coat and tufted toes and ears, making it the perfect companion for snowshoeing, raiding neighboring countries, and standing atop the dragon head on the prow of a Viking ship.</p>
